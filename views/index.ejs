      <b>Topics:</b>The proposal topic should be something that will be of interest to all attendees. It should be related to Lightning technologies: Salesforce1, Aura framework, Remote Objects, Connect, Lightning Studio, Javascript, Mobile, UX, etc. If your presentation is not within the aformentioned topics, get in contact with @uysdug so we can orientate on what we are expecting.

      <b>Abstract:</b>The Abstract field is where you’ll give a short paragraph to quickly tell us what you’re going to talk about.
